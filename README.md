# YouTube Clone (Practice Project)

This is a **practice front-end project** I built to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.  
It is **unfinished** and still a work in progress ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt able to complete it fully due to classes and exams, but I will continue updating and refining it soon.  

## Project Status
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout (works across mobile, tablet, and desktop)  
- ‚úÖ Functional sidebar toggle with JavaScript  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some flaws in structure and styling (to be fixed)  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing elements and features (to be added)  
- üîÑ Planned updates after exams (cleaner code, additional features, React version)  

## Tech Used
- HTML5 (with semantic tags like `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`)  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries, clamp(), responsiveness)  
- JavaScript (basic DOM manipulation for sidebar toggle)  
- Font Awesome icons  

## Goals
- Practice responsive web design  
- Recreate a familiar UI (YouTube) for layout experience  
- Improve at structuring HTML & CSS  
- Later: integrate APIs and rebuild with React

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project is not production-ready. It‚Äôs a personal learning exercise, and I‚Äôll continue to improve and update it in the coming weeks.
